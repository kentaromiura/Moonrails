    Welcome to this (really really ugly) example page,
    this is an example of a binary response:

    <img src="/assets/mucca.png" />

    in this stupid page you can <a href="/test/this/is/a/standard/tpl/controller">test</a> the standard tpl controller.

    the standard tpl controller is good for flat sites, but you will probably need a better action controller,
    luckily I've already wrote that, you can see an example here: <a href="/about">Who I am</a>

<pre class="footer"> INFO: your session id is: {session.SID}, expire at {session.cookie.expires} </pre>
